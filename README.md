# Alfred
some alfred workflows

- [new](https://github.com/banane77/Alfred)

  use this workflow to create a new application instance, such as Horizon View Client.


## How to Use  
just activate Alfred and type `new` , it will show applications in `/Applications` and `~/Applications`, select the app you want run .  
it will run as another instance if it's already running.  

if you want to filter the app list, just type `new` and the app name, such as `new appname` , it will show the apps which name contains `appname` in the list.

It's very useful for people like me who need to open multiple app instancesã€‚
